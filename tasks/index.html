    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

    <p><span>Создатель</span> <a href="#">Max Pavlov</a>,<span>отредактировано</span><a href="#">12 июн, 2019</a></p>

    <p>Version: June 11, 2019</p>

    <p>WARP is the simplest way to send files directly to a peer. Involvement of any third party is eliminated in a
        sense that files being sent only travel from sender's computer to a recipient's, omitting a man-in-the-middle
        approach, standard file transfer services utilize. WARP is a free service. We will refer to WAPR is "Service" in
        the following part of the document.
    </p>

    <p>Service is provided to you, the user of the Service, by Radacode Inc, with its main office in 980 Broadway,
        STE330, Thornwood, NY 10594.
    </p>

    <p>To make reading this document a breeze, we've made this a two-column document. Left column describes the
        official, binding Terms in 'legal speak'. The right column has a non-binding text in 'simple speak'. We are sure
        this will allow you to understand what we offer and on what terms much more easily.
    </p>


    <ol>
        <li><h2>Applicability</h2>
            <p>Please read the Terms of Service carefully. If you use our Service, you agree to the Terms of
                Service.</p>
        </li>

        <li><h2>Notice and Take Down Policy</h2>
            <p>Radacode respects your rights and expects that you will respect the rights of others. In the unfortunate
                event that Radacode finds or is notified of unlawful files or content being distributed through it’s
                Service, we will follow the procedures described in this Notice and Take Down Policy section of WARP
                Terms of Service.
            </p>
            <p>In essence, as Service never stores any piece of data from the files being sent on it's servers, the
                Service isn't responsible for take down of the potential copyright material. However, as the Service
                allows users to create a links to enable direct file transfers, and the links remain active as long as
                the sender is online and is connected via the Service, we can technically prohibit the particular link
                from being loaded on any recipient's side. This is the only form of take down that we are technically
                capable of performing.
            </p>
            <h3>Report requirements</h3>
            <p>Any person or organization that makes a Report ("Reporter") has the duty to ensure that it is correct and
                complete.</p>
            <p>Radacode should be able to verify that Reports following an investigation regarding a criminal offense
                have originated from an inspection or investigation service, or – in the case of a formal legal order –
                from the Public Prosecutor’s Office. A Report of any other nature than the foregoing should include at
                least the following information:
            </p>
            <p>Reporter's contact details, name, function, organization, address, email address);<br>
                All information Radacode needs in order to evaluate the lawfulness of the disputed content, including
                its location (URL);<br>
                Motivation as to the unlawfulness of the content, or why it is in conflict with WARP’s Terms of Service,
                NTD or Privacy Policy;<br>
                Motivation of the reason(s) why Radacode is the most appropriate intermediary to deal with the
                matter.<br>
                Upon receiving the report Radacode will investigate the case, categorize the breach of Policy and,
                possible block the URL that is allowing to access the sender's session. Radacode has no less than 10
                days to perform the investigation and respond to a Report. Upon procession of the report, the Reporter
                will be notified via email.
            </p>
            <p>Any questions regarding the Take Down Policy, as well as Reports, should be sent to <a
